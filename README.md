This script generates an array of numbers from 1 to 100 and replaces numbers according to the following rules:
- If a number is divisible by 3, it is replaced with `"BIG"`.
- If a number is divisible by 5, it is replaced with `"BANG"`.
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is replaced with `"BIGBANG"`.

The resulting array is saved to an `output.json` file.
